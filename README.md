 Client & Site Purpose

This website was made for a fictional client named Alex Jeffery, who is a portrait and lifestyle photographer based in the city.  
The purpose of the site is to show their photography work, explain the services they offer, and give people a way to book a session through the contact form.

 Design Changes from Assignment 1

The main design and layout was kept similar to the original Assignment 1 concept.  
Some small changs were made to spacing and layout so the website would look better on a computer screen and be easier for users to read and navigate.

 AI Usage

I used AI tools ChatGPT mainly to help with CSS styling and the basic structure of my HTML.  
It helped me understand how to use Flexbox and Grid for layout, and how to organize my pages better.  
The AI suggestions was helpful when I got stuck with positioning elements, and I learn more about how CSS works from using it.
