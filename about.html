    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Alex Jeffery, a portrait and lifestyle photographer based in the heart of the city.
      For over 8 years, I've had the privilege of capturing authentic moments that tell unique stories.
    </p>

    <p>
      My approach is simple: I believe the best photographs happen when you feel comfortable,
      confident, and completely yourself. Whether it's a portrait session or capturing everyday
      moments, I'm here to create images that you'll treasure for a lifetime.
